# wordcounters
Demonstration of word rank counter algorithm as described by Christian Rudder in "Dataclysm" to find Statistically Improbable Phrases (keywords)

Run through a given document to compile a list of frequencies of all the distinct words in a document.  Then rank-order the words by frequency. Repeat this process against a reference corpus for comparison. Look for words that appear in a highly different rank in the sample document than in the corpus.
